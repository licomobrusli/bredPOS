## Overview
BredPOS is an in-store application designed to assist customers in selecting and purchasing services. The app provides an estimated wait time, turn number, and receipt upon confirmation of the order.

## Installation
To run this app, you'll need to have the following set up:
- React Native environment
- PostgreSQL database
- Django backend running in Docker Compose

> **Note**: The PostgreSQL database and Django backend are not yet publicly available. Instructions for setting these up will be provided later.

## Usage
Currently, the app is in the development stage and does not have specific usage instructions.

The app communicates with two API endpoints to fetch service categories. More details will be provided once the Docker Compose repository is made public.
